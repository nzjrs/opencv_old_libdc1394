    <H1>Description</H1>

    </a>The library provides a Condensation engine for tracking purposes.&nbsp; In the
    application described below, the CAMSHIFT color tracking algorithm is used
    to provide measurements for the X-Y tracking of a face (or other colored
    object). The CAMSHIFT algorithm implemented here just uses a simple 1-D Hue
    histogram sampled from the object using an HSV color space.&nbsp; Therefore,
    the color tracker may need some tuning as described below (see CAMSHIFT demo
    description page for more details).
    <br><br>
    Note that this filter requires that you have DirectShow 6.0 or greater installed
    with <B>graphedt.exe&nbsp; </B>(DirectShow 6.0 for NT4.0, DirectShow 7.0 for
    Win 98 or Win2000)
    (<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?ReleaseID=16927">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?ReleaseID=16927</A> ~128MB[!]).
    You will also need a video camera source filter which should
    be supplied by your USB camera vendor. <!-- except most don't support NT4.0. -->
<!-- %%Some friendly advice from Uncle Gary?? -->
<!--    Win2000 is your best bet for development, for just running the filter graph, Win98 will do.. An example filter graph is shown below (with the calibration filter processing a video source from a Matrox Meteor II card that we wrote ourselves) and then passing the output to a video renderer. -->

    Microsoft* Windows* 2000 may be the most suitable operating system
    for development since many vendors do not supply filters for
    Windows NT 4.0. However, Windows 98 will be adequate for just
    running the filter graph.
    <h1>Condensation Color Tracker Demo</h1>
    You should setup or launch the following DirectShow filtergraph (of
    course, your capture source will depend on your USB camera):<br><br>

    <h2>Controls</h2>
    The control panel (obtained by right-clicking) for the
    Condensation filter in the filter graph above looks like:<br><br>

    <center><img border="0" src="CondensationDialog.jpg" width="386" height="280"></center>
    <br>
    <b><font size=+2>[1]</font></b> This control moves and
    sizes the
    sample window when you are not tracking.

    <br><b><font size=+2>[2]</font></b> This is the minimum saturation for a
    Hue pixel to be accepted threshold.

    <br><b><font size=+2>[3]</font></b> This is the minimum brightness for a
    Hue pixel to be accepted threshold.

    <br><b><font size=+2>[4]</font></b> This allows you to toggle between the
    raw video image and the Hue histogram backprojected image.

    <br><b><font size=+2>[5]</font></b> Samples color under box [1] and starts Condensation
    tracking.

    <br><b><font size=+2>[6]</font></b> Stop Condensation tracking.


    <h2>How to...</h2>
    <h3>Start Tracking</h3>
    1. Select Normal view [4].<br>
    2. Set the thresholds to zero [2] &amp; [3].<br>
    3. Move the sample box using [1] so that it covers the colored object to be tracked.<br>
    4. Press &quot;Start Track&quot; [5].<br>

    <h3>Tuning the tracking:</h3>
    1.Select Back Project view [4]. The goal is to have
        the image such as on the left below to look like the cleaner image on
        right below.<br>
    <br>
    <center><img border="0" src="../Kalman/kalmanbackNClean.jpg" width="649" height="240"></center>
    <br>
    2. Increase minimum saturation threshold [2] to clean up
    the image without diminishing the object of interest too much.<br>
    3. Increase minimum brightness threshold [3] to finish the
    &quot;clean up&quot; job.&nbsp; Don't turn too high or else bright spots
    on the tracked object will become &quot;holes&quot;.<br>
    4. Turn normal view back on [4].<br>
    <h2>Display</h2>
    The meaning of the normal view display is as follows with
    reference to the figure below:<br><br>
    <center><img border="0" src="../Kalman/kalmanTrackShot.jpg" width="320" height="240"></center>
    <font size=+2><b>[A]</b></font> Velocity direction and
    magnitude estimation.<br>
    <font size=+2><b>[B]</b></font> Sample window if not
    tracking, tracking window if tracking.<br>
    <font size=+2><b>[C]</b></font> Estimated location of&nbsp;
    the object.
