----------

VisEiCL:
- Pointers in EiC have been made unsafe. That is because the functions 
  in ippiCVL take unsafe pointers. This EiC mechanism 
  should be implemented by wrappers. Maybe it will be switched on if we 
  find a simple decision how to make wrappers support safe pointers.

HighGUI:
- Added destroy_image function that frees the memory allocated for bitmap.


11.01.2000
----------

Converters:
- Corrected the bug in converters. All converters were turning bitmaps
  upside down.
- Added fast converter from IPPIIMAGE to IPLIMAGE, that creates an IPL 
  header, but does not allocate memory and does not copy image data.


13.01.2000
----------

ALL:
- Removed memory leaks (all?)


14.01.2000
----------

VisEiCL:
- CHANGE IN PROJECT: *wrap.h files have been removed from VisEiCL.dsp. 
  From now on EiC uses library headers, like ippiCVL.h, ipl.h, etc.

18.01.2000
----------

HighGUI:
- Added HG_AUTOSIZE window style. See the docs for more info.


19.01.2000
----------

HighGUI:
- Added save_bitmap function


24.01.2000
----------

Hawk, VisEiCL:
- CHANGE IN PROJECT: The plugin mechanism has been implemented. ippiCVL
  and ipl wrapper functions are loaded to Hawk as plugins from now on.

25.01.2000
----------

Hawk:
- Popup menus with hints to all functions available in the interpreter
  have been implemented.

10.02.2000
----------

HighGUI:
- Added toolbar and trackbar controls and the functions working with them.
- Changed the scheme of windows, size calculation (due to controls).

18.02.2000
----------

ALL:
- Implemeted a script abort in case of a fatal error (e.g. load_bitmap fails
  to find the file specified). Abort happens only if the "Safe mode" flag is 
  set.

29.02.2000
----------

Hawk:
- Hawk text editor has been enhanced with syntax color highlighting and
  other useful features.

07.03.2000
----------

Converters:
- Added the function play_avi that is temporarily places in converters block.
  This function plays avi video file, calling a script function on every 
  displayed frame.

14.04.2000
----------

VisEiCL:
- Incorporated with next EiC version, 4.2.6, which is more stable.
